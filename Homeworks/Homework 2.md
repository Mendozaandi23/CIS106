## Part 1
Watch these videos:
* [What is Open Source?](https://bit.ly/3bQwE3z)
* [Open Source vs. Closed Source Software](https://bit.ly/3irHu1b)
* [Open Source Basics | Intel Software](https://bit.ly/2LBF8RK)

Answer the following question:

1. **What are the advantages of open source?**
   Some of the advantages of open sources are: 
* The agility and flexibility
* Cost effectiveness 
* Speed 
* Share maintenance cost
* Solid information security  
2. **What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?**
* The freedom to run the program to do whatever you want or for any purpose.
* The freedom to analyze the program functions and change it in the way you want it to work. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. 
 
3. **Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?**
   The are some ways because people must use the free software/open-source alternative such as: 
* Free software 
	You can own your Software
* Safe and extend your hardware life
* Reduce cost
* Trust what’s going on

4. **Watch the following video: [Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPPikY3uLIQ) Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.**
   Well, I do not know exactly if to be agree or disagree to what he says in the video but what can I say is that currently many people use proprietary software that denies users these freedoms and benefits. If people make a copy and give it to a friend, if they try to figure out how the program works, if they put a copy on more than one of our own computers in our own home, people could be caught and fined or put in jail. That’s what’s in the fine print of the license agreement you accept when using proprietary software.



## Part 2
